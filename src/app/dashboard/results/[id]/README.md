## Refactored Structure

The page has been refactored into smaller, more maintainable components:

### Main Files
- `page.tsx` - Main page component that orchestrates everything
- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `hooks/` - Custom hooks for data management
- `components/` - Individual UI components

### Benefits of Refactoring
1. **Improved Maintainability** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Better Reusability** - Components can be used in other parts of the application
3. **Easier Testing** - Smaller components are easier to test in isolation
4. **Enhanced Readability** - Code is organized logically
5. **Simplified Debugging** - Issues can be isolated to specific components
