# Import Path Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the import path fixes made to resolve module not found errors after refactoring the Mapolio frontend codebase.

## Issues Identified
Two import errors were identified after the refactoring:
1. `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/scrape/ScrapeActions'`
2. `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/scrape/scrapingService'`

## Root Cause
During the refactoring process, files were moved to new directory structures but some import paths were not updated accordingly:
- `ScrapeActions.tsx` was moved from `src/components/scrape/` to `src/components/scrape/actions/`
- `scrapingService.ts` was moved from `src/components/scrape/` to `src/components/scrape/services/`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ScrapeContent.tsx
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/scrape/components/ScrapeContent.tsx`
**Change**: Updated import path for ScrapeActions
```typescript
// Before
import ScrapeActions from '@/components/scrape/ScrapeActions'

// After
import ScrapeActions from '@/components/scrape/actions/ScrapeActions'
```

### 2. useScrapeForm.ts
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/scrape/hooks/useScrapeForm.ts`
**Change**: Updated import path for ScrapingService
```typescript
// Before
import { ScrapingService } from '@/components/scrape/scrapingService'

// After
import { ScrapingService } from '@/components/scrape/services/scrapingService'
```

### 3. TasksDataContext.tsx
**File**: `src/contexts/TasksDataContext.tsx`
**Change**: Updated import path for ScrapingService
```typescript
// Before
import { ScrapingService } from '@/components/scrape/scrapingService'

// After
import { ScrapingService } from '@/components/scrape/services/scrapingService'
```

## Verification
All files were checked for syntax errors and no issues were found. The import paths now correctly point to the refactored directory structure.

└── contexts/
    └── TasksDataContext.tsx (imports updated)
```

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always update import paths when moving files to new directories
2. Use the project's index files for imports when possible to abstract away specific file locations
3. Run verification checks after refactoring to catch any broken imports
4. Consider using TypeScript's "Go to Definition" feature to verify import paths are correct
