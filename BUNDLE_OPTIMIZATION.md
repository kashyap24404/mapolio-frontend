# Bundle Optimization Guide

This document outlines the bundle optimization strategies implemented in the Mapolio frontend.

## 1. Dynamic Imports & Code Splitting

### Heavy Components Made Dynamic
The following components are now dynamically imported to reduce initial bundle size:

- `DashboardGrid` - Main dashboard component with charts and stats
- `ScrapeForm` - Complex form with multiple sections and validation
- `TaskDetailContent` - Detailed task view with data visualization
- `MultiSelect` - Complex dropdown with search and filtering
- `PurchaseHistory` - Data-heavy transaction history
- `CreditCalculator` - Pricing calculator with complex logic
- `ThemeToggle` - Client-side only theme switching
- `LoginModal` - Authentication modal (loaded on demand)

### Usage Example
```typescript
import { DashboardGrid } from '@/components/dynamic'

// Component loads with skeleton, then replaces with actual content
<DashboardGrid />
```

## 2. Icon Optimization

### Centralized Icon Management
All Lucide React icons are now imported individually through `@/lib/icons` to enable better tree shaking:

```typescript
// Instead of this (imports entire library):
import { Search, User, Settings } from 'lucide-react'

// Use this (only imports needed icons):
import { Search, User, Settings } from '@/lib/icons'
```

### Available Optimized Icons
- Dashboard & Navigation: `LayoutDashboard`, `Search`, `FileText`, `Settings`, `User`, etc.
- Actions: `Plus`, `Download`, `Upload`, `RefreshCw`, `Play`, etc.
- Status: `CheckCircle`, `XCircle`, `AlertCircle`, `Clock`, `Loader2`
- Form & UI: `Check`, `X`, `Eye`, `EyeOff`, `Lock`, `Mail`, `MapPin`
- Navigation: `ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`, `Home`, chevron variants

## 3. Next.js Configuration Optimizations

### Webpack Optimizations
- Bundle analyzer support (run `npm run build:analyze`)
- Optimized package imports for lucide-react
- Tree shaking enhancements
- Production source map disabling

### Image & Compression
- WebP/AVIF image format support
- Compression enabled
- Extended cache TTL for images

### Build Configuration
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:analyze": "ANALYZE=true next build --turbopack"
  }
}
```

## 4. Component Loading Strategies

### Skeleton Loading States
Each dynamically imported component has a corresponding skeleton loader:
- Maintains layout during loading
- Improves perceived performance
- Prevents layout shift

### SSR Considerations
Heavy interactive components are disabled for SSR (`ssr: false`) to:
- Reduce server-side rendering time
- Prevent hydration mismatches
- Improve initial page load

## 5. Import Best Practices

### DO ✅
```typescript
// Use centralized icon imports
import { Search, User } from '@/lib/icons'

// Use dynamic imports for heavy components
import { DashboardGrid } from '@/components/dynamic'

// Import only what you need
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

### DON'T ❌
```typescript
// Don't import entire libraries
import * as Icons from 'lucide-react'

// Don't import heavy components directly in critical paths
import DashboardGrid from '@/components/dashboard/DashboardGrid'

// Don't use barrel exports for large libraries
import { Component1, Component2, Component3 } from 'large-library'
```

## 6. Performance Monitoring

### Bundle Analysis
Run bundle analysis to monitor bundle size:
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

This generates reports in the `analyze/` directory showing:
- Bundle size breakdown
- Chunk analysis
- Dependency visualization

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Initial bundle size (should be < 250KB gzipped)
- Number of chunks
- Largest dependencies
- Unused exports

## 7. Future Optimizations

### Potential Improvements
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Add service worker for caching
- Optimize font loading
- Implement progressive image loading
- Add bundle budget enforcement

### Monitoring Tools
Consider integrating:
- webpack-bundle-analyzer (already added)
- Bundle size CI checks
- Performance budgets
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)

## 8. Migration Notes

When migrating existing components to use optimized imports:

1. Replace lucide-react imports with @/lib/icons
2. Consider making heavy components dynamic
3. Add proper loading states
4. Test SSR behavior
5. Monitor bundle size impact

This optimization strategy should result in:
- 20-30% reduction in initial bundle size
- Faster initial page loads
- Better user experience with progressive loading
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores
