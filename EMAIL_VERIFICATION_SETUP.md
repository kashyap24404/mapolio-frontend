# Email Verification Setup for Mapolio

## Overview
Email verification has been implemented to ensure users confirm their email addresses before accessing the application. This adds an extra layer of security and helps prevent fake accounts.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Modified Supabase Provider**
- Updated `signUp` function to handle email verification flow
- Added `emailRedirectTo` parameter pointing to `/auth/callback`
- Returns additional properties: `needsVerification` and `email`

### 2. **Email Verification Flow**
1. **User Signs Up**: Enters email, password, and optional display name
2. **Verification Email Sent**: Supabase sends verification email to user
3. **User Clicks Link**: Email contains link to `/auth/callback`
4. **Account Activated**: User can now sign in

### 3. **New Components Created**

#### **Auth Callback Page** (`/auth/callback`)
- Handles email verification when users click the link in their email
- Automatically signs in users after successful verification
- Redirects to dashboard upon successful verification
- Shows error messages for failed verifications

#### **Enhanced LoginModal**
- Shows verification sent screen after successful signup
- Displays user's email address for confirmation
- Provides "Back to Sign In" option
- Handles verification-specific error messages

#### **Enhanced Sign-In Page**
- Similar verification flow to LoginModal
- Full-page experience with verification status
- Integrated error handling for unconfirmed emails

### 4. **User Experience**

#### **Sign-Up Process**
1. User fills out sign-up form
2. Upon submission, verification email is sent
3. User sees "Check Your Email" screen with their email address
4. User clicks verification link in email
5. User is redirected to callback page and automatically signed in

#### **Sign-In Process**
1. If user tries to sign in with unverified email, they see appropriate error message
2. Error directs them to check their email for verification link

### 5. **Error Handling**
- **Unverified Email**: Clear message directing user to verify email
- **Invalid Verification Link**: Error page with retry options
- **Network Issues**: Graceful error handling with retry mechanisms

## Configuration Requirements

### Supabase Dashboard Settings
To enable email verification, configure the following in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to Authentication > Settings**
2. **Enable email confirmations**:
   - Toggle "Enable email confirmations" to ON
3. **Set redirect URLs**:
   - Add your domain + `/auth/callback` to allowed redirect URLs
   - Example: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`, `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Security Benefits
- **Prevents fake accounts**: Users must have access to valid email
- **Reduces spam**: Email verification deters automated signups
- **Ensures communication**: Verified emails enable reliable user communication
- **Compliance**: Meets industry standards for user verification

## File Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── callback/
│   │       └── page.tsx          # Email verification handler
│   └── signin/
│       └── page.tsx              # Enhanced with verification flow
├── components/
│   └── auth/
│       └── LoginModal.tsx        # Enhanced with verification UI
└── lib/
    └── supabase-provider.tsx     # Updated signUp function
```

## Testing the Flow
1. **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to sign-in page**: `/signin`
3. **Create new account** with a real email address
4. **Check your email** for verification link
5. **Click verification link** - should redirect to `/auth/callback` then `/dashboard`
6. **Try signing in** before verification - should show error message

## Troubleshooting
- **Not receiving emails**: Check Supabase email settings and spam folder
- **Verification fails**: Ensure redirect URLs are correctly configured
- **Callback errors**: Check browser console for detailed error messages
