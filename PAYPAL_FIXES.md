# PayPal Integration Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve the "Unauthorized" error in the PayPal integration.

## Issues Identified

1. **Session Not Being Passed**: The PayPal order creation API was not receiving the user session properly due to missing credentials in the fetch request.

2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The error messages were not detailed enough to diagnose the root cause.

3. **Environment Variable Validation**: No validation was being performed on required PayPal environment variables.

4. **User Authentication Check**: The frontend was not verifying if the user was authenticated before attempting to create an order.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Handling
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to the fetch request in the [createOrder](file:///D:/DRM%20-%20LIFE/Bin%20Store/Backup%20-%202%20-%20with%20major%20update/Backup%20Scraping/Frontend/mapolio-frontend/src/app/dashboard/pricing/page.tsx#L115-L134) function to ensure cookies are sent with the request
- Added detailed logging in the API route to verify session data
- Added explicit user authentication check in the frontend before creating orders

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages in both the frontend and backend
- Added specific error handling for different failure scenarios
- Improved logging for debugging purposes

### 3. Environment Variable Validation
- Added validation checks in the PayPal client to ensure required environment variables are set
- Created a test API route to verify environment variable configuration

### 4. Test Pages
- Created a test page at `/dashboard/test-paypal` to verify PayPal integration
- Created a session test page at `/dashboard/test-session` to verify user authentication
- Added environment variable checking functionality

## Testing the Fixes

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/test-session to verify your session status
2. If not authenticated, sign in to your account
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/test-paypal to verify environment variables
4. Click "Create Test Order" to test PayPal order creation
5. Check browser console and server logs for detailed error information

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
