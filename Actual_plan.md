# 🏗️ Mapolio State Management & Data-Fetching Architecture Refactoring Plan
## 📊 Current State Analysis
### 🔍 Critical Issues Identified
1. 1.
   Tab Focus Storm Problem
   
   - Browser tab focus events trigger complete context teardown and rebuild
   - useActiveOnVisible hook causes cascading re-renders and data refetches
   - No proper caching or state persistence across visibility changes
2. 2.
   Redundant Request Storm
   
   - Multiple contexts fetch the same/similar data independently
   - No shared caching layer between contexts
   - 60-second timeouts with 3 retries per request type = 12+ concurrent requests
   - No request deduplication or batching
3. 3.
   State Management Anti-Patterns
   
   - Contexts re-initialize on every user change (even when user ID hasn't changed)
   - No separation between global app state and component-local state
   - Missing stale-while-revalidate pattern
   - No proper error boundaries or retry strategies
4. 4.
   Performance Bottlenecks
   
   - Sequential data fetching instead of parallelization where safe
   - No progressive enhancement or skeleton states
   - Loading states trigger additional re-renders
## 🎯 New Architecture Design
### 🏛️ Layered Architecture
### 🔄 New Data Flow Strategy
1. 1.
   Smart Caching with SWR
   
   - Implement Stale-While-Revalidate pattern
   - Cache data across tab visibility changes
   - Automatic background revalidation
   - Request deduplication and batching
2. 2.
   Centralized State Management
   
   - Replace multiple contexts with Zustand stores
   - Separate concerns: Auth, Data, UI, Real-time
   - Persistent storage for critical data
   - Optimistic updates
3. 3.
   Strategic Data Loading
   
   - Critical data: Load immediately with caching
   - Secondary data: Load on demand with prefetching
   - Real-time data: WebSocket with reconnection logic
   - Background sync for offline capability
4. 4.
   Performance Optimizations
   
   - Progressive loading with skeleton states
   - Request coalescing and debouncing
   - Connection pooling optimization
   - Error boundary implementation
## 📋 Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Setup Zustand stores for global state management
- Implement SWR for data fetching and caching
- Create data service layer abstraction
- Setup error boundaries and retry strategies
### Phase 2: Core State Migration (Week 3-4)
- Migrate ScrapeDataContext → Zustand store with SWR
- Migrate TasksDataContext → Zustand store with real-time sync
- Migrate UserStatsContext → Zustand store with caching
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Week 5-6)
- Add request deduplication and batching
- Implement progressive loading states
- Optimize real-time subscriptions
- Add offline capability with background sync
### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (Week 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing of all data flows
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Error handling validation
- Documentation and monitoring setup
